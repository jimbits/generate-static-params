# Generate Static Params
This example shows you how to use the NEXT.js generateStaticParams function when using dynamic route segments. If you were using the pages directory to create pages at build time you would use the getStaticProps function router you had the options of getStaticProps to statically generate routes at build time. By default dynamic routes are created on-demand at request time. If you have all of the data in place for a page you can build the page a head of time. Maki
